= Docker build container example

This example shows how to use Docker to compile a file inside a container and
return the results back to the host filesystem. Example use cases include
packaging existing programs for different package managers where we maybe don't
want to spin up a full VM for each target distribution.

To obtain an `out/hello.txt` file in the current working directory, where the
file was created inside a container we'll build and spin up, run:

----
$ make
----

Changing the text written to the file in `builder.sh` will not cause a rebuild
of the container, but re-running it will pick up any changes we make.
